# MUTN Password Manager
Pronounced as: "mutton", "muhÂ·tn"

MUTN is a simple, self-hosted, SSH-synchronized password manager based on libmutton.

MUTN is an expanded re-implementation of [sshyp](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp) written in Go.

Though MUTN will feel very familiar to users of sshyp, it is intended to differ and will break entry compatibility before reaching a stable release.
# WARNING
It is your responsibility to assess the security and stability of MUTN and to ensure it meets your needs before using it.
I am not responsible for any data loss or breaches of your information resulting from the use of MUTN.
MUTN is a new project that is constantly being updated, and though safety and security are priorities, they cannot be guaranteed.

# Mission Statement
MUTN aims to make it as simple as possible to manage passwords and notes via CLI across multiple devices in a secure, self-hosted fashion.

# Building
MUTN is currently in early development and does not yet have online synchronization functionality (offline only).

To build the current version of MUTN, simply clone this repository and run `go build` in its root directory.
