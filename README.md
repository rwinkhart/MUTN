# MUTN Password Manager
Pronounced as: "mutton", "muhÂ·tn"

MUTN is a simple, self-hosted, SSH-synchronized password manager based on libmutton.

MUTN is an expanded re-implementation of [sshyp](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp) written in Go.

Though MUTN will feel very familiar to users of sshyp, it is intended to differ and breaks compatibility with its entry format.

# Mission Statement
MUTN aims to make it as simple as possible to manage passwords and notes via CLI across multiple devices in a secure, self-hosted fashion.

# Building
This repository is currently home to both the MUTN client and the general libmutton server software.

Official binaries are stripped of debug info for size and built without CGO (except for distribution packages) for portability, as follows:
```
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" ./mutn.go
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" ./libmuttonserver.go
```
