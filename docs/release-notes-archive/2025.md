**WARNING: AS LIBMUTTON HAS NOT YET REACHED v1.0.0, [BREAKING CHANGES](https://github.com/rwinkhart/libmutton/blob/main/wiki/breaking.md) IN FUTURE UPDATES ARE PLANNED**

**MUTN v0.3.0**
Built with libmutton v0.4.0
DRAFT

# The Cryptic Cuts Update
This is the largest update to MUTN yet, and as such, these patch notes are non-exhaustive.
Many minor changes and fixes to features mentioned in these patch notes have been made.
Please see the commit history for a more complete list of changes.

This is a major, breaking release that changes the encryption scheme used for entries.
This version of MUTN requires `mutn init` to be run before use.
Additionally, it requires previously created entries to be converted using the conversion program linked below.

## libmutton-derived Changes
- **PLEASE** read [libmutton's release notes](https://github.com/rwinkhart/libmutton/releases/tag/v0.4.0), as they detail severe breaking changes
    - Highlight feature: GPG has been entirely replaced with [RCW](https://github.com/rwinkhart/rcw)
        - All entries created in previous versions _**MUST**_ be converted using [this conversion program](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp-labs/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

## Features
- (05f95a4c0c8a854828161c9d3f70e8cff6da0fc5) Implemented "mutn tweak" for performing various quick operations
    - These currently include:
        1. (1488c7d5360fc6f0ac7489e4925247732f687f1e) Changing the device ID
        2. (59cb9ac0d18defa201713f91f033702339ff45e6) Re-encrypting/optimizing entries (changing the passphrase)
        3. (45c03f0fe4435cb7e619c80b2a91157405d2a7c9) Setting/changing the editor used for notes

## Changes
- (0895dcba8ae3435b35e1821ece9a6a924fde5905) (52628dba0a3a959784a6706216615bb7babced09) A temporary fork of Glamour v0.7.0 is now used
    - This fixes the long-dreaded startup latency caused by Glamour's dependency on [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma)
    - Chroma has been replaced with [go-highlite](https://github.com/rwinkhart/go-highlite)
    - This also reduces the binary size by several megabytes
    - This solution is temporary: Two alternative markdown rendering solutions are in the works and one will be chosen to replace Glamour entirely
- (72755e91b582dd2f6b93f0aa30992da4dc10750d) `edit` is now the default note editor on Windows
- (cc3416a89c119076e3ce84252029e952288ecf35) Release binaries now target x86_64_v2 and arm64v8.7+crypto (v8.0 still offered on Linux)

## Fixes
- (85584da807a5d973078d6357decdc7a1092582f3) The entry reader loop is now broken as intended once notes have been printed

## Dependencies
- Dropped
    - Many dependencies were dropped due to the removal of experimental build options
    - github.com/alecthomas/chroma/v2 was dropped as part of the Glamour fork
    - github.com/fortis/go-steam-totp was dropped due to libmutton now using one package for all TOTP generation
- Bumped (direct)
    - Go: v1.24.2 => 1.24.4
    - github.com/rwinkhart/libmutton: v0.3.1 => v0.4.0
    - golang.org/x/term: v0.31.0 => v0.32.0
