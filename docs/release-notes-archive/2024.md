# The Tripe Transmission Update - Patch 1

This release marks the completion of splitting MUTN and [libmutton](https://github.com/rwinkhart/libmutton) into separate repositories. The server binary must now be downloaded from the [libmutton releases page](https://github.com/rwinkhart/libmutton/releases).

Please see the [installation guide](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/install.md) for updated instructions.

## Breaking Changes
- The server binary must also be updated to v0.2.1 (grab it [here](https://github.com/rwinkhart/libmutton/releases/tag/v0.2.1))

## Features
- From libmutton v0.2.1:
    - MUTN will now remove the previous device ID from the server when creating a new one
    - Exit codes are now specific to the type of error encountered

## Fixes
- From libmutton v0.2.1:
    - The user is no longer prompted for their ssh keyfile passphrase multiple times during synchronization
    - Config/entry files are now created with 0600 permissions
    - The TOTP copy message is no longer unnecessarily verbose
- Function documentation is now properly formatted for display on pkg.go.dev

## Dependencies
- Bumps (direct and indirect)
    - golang.org/x/sys: v0.23.0 => v0.24.0

**MUTN v0.2.0**
August 06, 2024

# The Tripe Transmission Update

This release marks the public debut of MUTN and its underlying library, libmutton.

Compared to v0.1.0, this version adds fully native SSH synchronization with self-hosted servers. It also makes tweaks to the entry format to better integrate TOTP support. The full patch notes are below.

## Breaking Changes
#### Given MUTN was not public prior to this release, these should not affect anyone and are listed purely for historical documentation
- (67bf6e42b9c623f24d9547d822ea4d2fd45002d1) TOTP secrets now have their own dedicated entry field, meaning entries from v0.1.0 are not compatible
- Various changes have been made to libmutton.ini (re-generating it with `mutn init` is needed)

## Features
- Native SSH sync support with self-hosted servers
    - Replaces sshyp-based partial sync implementation, requires libmuttonserver)
- (ea34f644f31ff871d8766d3971dac5eed5bb2c3b) MUTN/libmutton can now be built for WSL with working clipboard support
    - Build tag: `wsl`
- (356d1eab4e4cd0c68db9bd9aa0d3164c13cd254f) libmutton can now be built to allow functions to exit the program (desirable for CLI) or return (desirable for GUI/TUI)
    - Build tag: `returnOnExit`
- (cbf625b2d3b8a18d1f7e3214e065b5baa1dc0829) MUTN can now be built without Markdown support
    - Build tag: `noMarkdown`
    - Reduces the binary size by more than half and greatly reduces startup time (because of this, Glamour is likely to be replaced with a different Markdown renderer in the future)
- (f0cdd217d958109f36a0e8a7048a5d73b7f68a96) PowerShell completions now also work on non-Windows platforms
- (2ae4fe19e84d9beacfc616c9aa4fe9c166d28003) (e81bfa935a1f461edf2171f99f37ac2794a928e8) It is now possible for third-party clients to store and retrieve data from arbitrary section headers in libmutton.ini

## Fixes
- Several previously unhandled errors are not handled properly
    - sync/client.go is the last to have not received this treatment (coming in v0.2.1)
- PowerShell completions can now complete after directories containing spaces
- (0fc0a2cfc09289271bc90a292fa7f40289a35294) Bash and ZSH completions no longer declare generically named global variables that could conflict with other software
- (43d87a5b464b997b7f719b71626d62840e385333) "-v" and "-h" shortcuts (for "version" and "help", respectively) have been removed to prevent ambiguity in PowerShell
- (df5f10d188b80a17eeed48961c4e64c90166f7e6) ANSI escapes are no longer intermittently dumped to the terminal on Windows
- (35192fa568010a72f49536197115081b00b4f0da) MUTN will no longer wait for you to fill out the contents of a new entry before telling you its location is invalid
- (b7a470116ab90b327d16e96e9576f002eeea2902) MUTN no longer announces the copying of TOTP codes until the entry has been successfully decrypted

## Dependencies
- Bumps (direct and indirect)
    - Go: v1.22.2 => v1.22.6
    - golang.org/x/crypto: v0.22.0 => v0.26.0

    - golang.org/x/sys: v0.19.0 => v0.23.0
- New (direct)
    - github.com/pkg/sftp: v1.13.6

## Installation Notes
Though this is the initial public debut, it is still an overall early release of MUTN/libmutton. Because of this, no distribution packages are provided as of yet. MUTN is, however, available as a source package from the AUR as "mutn". Please see the [install guide](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/install.md) for help installing or building MUTN in its current state (as well as getting started).

Note that libmuttonserver, libmutton, and MUTN have not yet been separated into their own respective repos (this will be done for v0.2.1). As such, libmuttonserver is built with the `noMarkdown` build tag to avoid pulling in Glamour and its dependencies.

It is highly recommended to also install the relevant [shell completions](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/completions.md).

**MUTN v0.1.0**
April 16, 2024

# The Butchered Update

This is the first tagged release of MUTN.

It is a mostly complete implementation of MUTN's offline functionality.

It supports basic online synchronization if [sshyp](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp) is also installed and configured (UNIX-based systems only).

**Breaking changes will be made after this release, including, but not limited to:**
- GPG will be replaced as the default encryption method
- The entry format will be adjusted to contain a dedicated field for TOTP secrets
- sshyp-based synchronization will be replaced with a native implementation

**No pre-compiled binaries or distribution packages will be published for this release.**
