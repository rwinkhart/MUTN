### Clipboard managers can break libmutton-based password managers
***
The intended way for libmutton to interact with the system clipboard is for it to clear it 30 seconds after copying a field. **Unfortunately, this does not work by default on all systems due to the prevalence of clipboard managers.**

Clipboard managers save a history of what has been copied to the clipboard, which is already a big enough issue on its own for people who copy sensitive information to their clipboard. Some **clipboard managers simply will not allow the clipboard to be empty** and will replace its contents with the last copied item if you attempt to clear it. One such naughty clipboard manager is **KDE Klipper**, which comes **packaged into KDE Plasma** and is typically **enabled by default** on most distributions. Due to this behavior, **KDE Klipper breaks libmutton's clipboard clearing functionality** and should not be left enabled.

It is likely other popular clipboard managers exhibit this behavior. I noticed it with KDE Klipper, which is what prompted me to create this wiki page. **Clipboard managers should not be enabled by default in any environment** or distribution due to their **potential security implications**.
### Termux cannot clear the clipboard from the background
***
If using libmutton on Termux (Android), the clipboard may not successfully be cleared after the 30 second timeout period if Termux is not actively in the foreground when the sleep timer expires. This is an unfortunate side-effect of running on Android and cannot be easily fixed. Due to Termux being at the bottom of the platform support priority list, I will not be investing time into working around this.
