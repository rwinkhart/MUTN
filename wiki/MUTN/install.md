## Installation
MUTN is still in early development and thus no installation packages are officially distributed.

For now, please manually install the binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/releases) or [compile from source](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/MUTN/build.md).

Please note that the server binary must be called "libmuttonserver" in order for clients to successfully reach it.

After placing the binaries in your $PATH, it is highly recommended to also download and correctly place/source the relevant [shell completions scripts](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/MUTN/completions.md).

Please see the [usage guide](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/MUTN/usage.md) for help getting started.
