## Installation
MUTN is still in early development and thus no installation packages are officially distributed.

For now, please [compile from source](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/MUTN/build.md).

After compiling and placing the binaries in your $PATH, it is highly recommended to also download and correctly place/source the relevant shell completions scripts. [Shell completions are provided for ZSH, Bash, and PowerShell 7+](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/tree/main/completions).

For help with completions scrips, see [completions troubleshooting](https://github.com/rwinkhart/MUTN/blob/main/wiki/MUTN/completions.md).
